            <h2>Our Building Process</h2>
            <p>OldStyle Homes adhere to the following building process</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Draft plan and site plan locations</h3>
            <p>We understand every person's has different needs and requirements. That is why we work with each client individually to come up with a design that suits you.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Preliminary estimate.</h3>
            <p>Once we have completed the draft plan we can provide you with an estimate of the cost. This price is simply a guideline to work with and we can make changes as necessary to meet your budget.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Preliminary Agreement</h3>
            <p>Having agreed on a preliminary estimate we ask for a HIA preliminary agreement to be signed before we proceed any further with more detailed plans, soil tests and engineering details.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Preliminary plans drafted</h3>
            <p>The next step is to send your draft plan to our design team to turn your ideas into a workable plan. It is at this stage we arrange a soil test to be carried out on your land.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Fine tuning</h3>
            <p>Generally within two weeks we receive your preliminary plans and from here you can take the plans to look over and we can discuss any changes you wish to make.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Price estimate</h3>
            <p>With the fine tuning completed we can then provide a much more accurate price estimate based on our standard inclusions as well as discuss any changes to these inclusions based on your preferences and budget.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Working plans</h3>
            <p>With the preliminary plans and any changes finalized we will arrange for the working drawings, including the engineering drawings and requirements, to be completed.</p>

            <h3>Step 8: Fixed price</h3>
            <p>We can then provide you with a fixed price based on the drawings and inclusions list that we have agreed upon and you can rest in the knowledge that there will be no hidden extras.</p>

            <h3>Step 9: Contracts</h3>
            <p>With our working drawings and fixed price we can now complete a HIA fixed price contract.</p>

            <h3>Step 10: Let's Build</h3>
            <p>Once the necessary paperwork has been received and all the necessary approvals in we can commence construction of your new home. We will keep you informed all along the way of how your build is progressing including giving you access to the client progress area of our website so that you can monitor the progress.</p>

            <h3>Step 11: Handover</h3>
            <p>Once everything is completed we will take you for a final inspection of your home to ensure you are happy. When you are happy and all monies finalized we will present you with the keys to your new home.</p>

            <h3>Step 12: Move In</h3>
            <p>The only thing left now is for you to move in and enjoy your new home reassured that your new home is covered by our standard warranty.</p>
